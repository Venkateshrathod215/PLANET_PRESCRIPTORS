Problem Statement
Title:THE PLANET PRESCRIPTION: Closing the "Last-Mile" Gap in Pharmaceutical Waste Management using AI and Cloud-Scale Logistics.

1. The Context:
  India is one of the world's largest consumers of pharmaceuticals, yet it lacks a formal system for Household Medical Waste (HMW).
  Unlike hospital waste, HMW is currently mixed with municipal trash, leading to illegal burning in dump yards.
  This releases dioxins and furans, resulting in respiratory crises and child fatalities in urban fringes like Bengaluru.

2. The Technical Gap:
  The fundamental barrier is not just "waste"—it is unstructured data and fragmented logistics.
Identification Crisis: Millions of citizens cannot distinguish between "low-risk" vitamins and
  "high-risk" antibiotics/hormonal drugs, leading to improper disposal.
Logistics Invisibility: There is no real-time tracking or predictive system to aggregate small quantities of waste from
  millions of homes into a "bulk-load" large enough for industrial incineration.
Regulatory Blind Spot: Current policy cannot enforce rules because there is no transparent, verifiable data trail (Chain of Custody)
  from the household to the treatment plant.

Why This Idea Matters 
1.Prevents deaths and disease caused by toxic emissions from waste burning. 
2.Closes a critical gap in biomedical waste management—household medicines. 
3.Reduces antibiotic resistance and endocrine disruption caused by environmental contamination. 
4.Transforms waste into value, through energy recovery and material reuse. 5.Scales from individual households to villages,
districts, states, and nationally, creating measurable environmental impact.
